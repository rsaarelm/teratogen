Building
--------

- Make sure the dev packages of SDL and SDL_mixer are installed. You need to
  have have sdl-config in your path.

- Install the Go language development environment from
  <http://golang.org/doc/install.html>. Make sure you set $GOROOT, $GOOS and
  $GOARCH environment variables according to the instructions.

- Call "make" at teratogen base dir.

- The teratogen binary is at cmd/teratogen/teratogen

The current build system writes the game's libraries into the main Go install
tree, so you will need to have write permissions there. This should change in
the future.
