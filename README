Teratogen is a survival horror roguelike work-in-progress written in the Go
programming language by Risto Saarelma.

Where are the prebuilt binaries?
--------------------------------

The current (2010-01-07) Go build system hardcodes the paths of shared
objects, such as the SDL FFI bindings object, into the binary. This makes it
difficult to build binaries who need to access their libraries from an
undefined directory.

The easiest way to get Teratogen working as of now is to install Go and build
it yourself. See the INSTALL file for build instructions.

Where's the Windows version?
----------------------------

Currently (2010-01-07) waiting for the mingw32 support of Go to appear in the
main branch. The experimental Windows fork currently available only supports
an older version of the Go language and won't build Teratogen.

The Hyades packages
-------------------

Possibly reusable and library-like Go code goes into the package directories
in pkg/hyades.
