Termbox is a library that provides a minimalistic API which allows the
programmer to write text-based user interfaces. The library is crossplatform
and have both terminal-based implementations on *nix operating systems and
winapi console based implementation on windows operating system. The basic
idea is an abstraction of the greatest common subset of features available
on all major terminals and other terminal-like APIs in a minimalistic fashion.
Small API means it is easy to implement, test, maintain and learn it, that's
what makes the termbox a distinct library in its area.

For examples of what can be done take a look at demos in the _demos directory.
You can try them out that way:
	go run _demos/keyboard.go

Also take a look at the godit, it is a text editor written using termbox, you
can find it here: https://github.com/nsf/godit
